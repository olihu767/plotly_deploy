## Background 
Roza has a partially completed dashboard, but she needs to finish it. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

## Objectives

* Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
* Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
* Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.

## Resources

* Data Source: samples.json
* Software: Visual Studio Code 1.43.0, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
* Libraries: D3.js, Plotly.js

## Usage
Note: Please ensure you have all the required and updated softwares on your computer.
1. Download the following files into the same folder for the project.

plots.js
index.html
style.css
samples.json

2. Open Visual Studio Code from your project's folder.

3. If you would like to run the webpage without deploying it, it will display a CORS error unless you run a local server. In your terminal or Git Bash, navigate to your folder and type the following:

python -m http.server

4. This will run the files and provide you with a URL. Copy and paste it into your browser.

5. If you would like to change the favicon, you can create the icon from any favicon generator and add the files into your folder. The link I used is the following: https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/.
